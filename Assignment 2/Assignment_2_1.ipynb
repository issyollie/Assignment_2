    "# Assignment Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you are required to create a **report** that includes your approach to the challenges presented in practical **Labs 5, 6, and 7**. The report should be in the form of a **Jupyter Notebook** and should contain a **GitHub repository** where all the code used can be replicated to achieve the same results. You can use the same repository you shared during Assignment No 1, but describe where the new labs will be included. \n",
    "\n",
    "**General Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Include the coursework cover page available in the Virtual Office as the initial section of your report, with all relevant information and the GitHub repository link, but exclude the word count.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. You can structure your report as you prefer, but try to be consistent, organized and clear. You can use the same repository you shared during Assignment No 1, but describe where the new labs will be included. \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. To avoid exceeding the size limit of a GitHub repository, it may not be possible to push a notebook containing all outcomes. To address this issue, please include a screenshot of the last outcome of each challenge using the description cells in the notebook. Once included, clear all outcomes to reduce the notebook's size. I will reproduce the code and compare the images you provided with the outcomes I obtained while running your code to ensure that I get the same results.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. Once again, you can structure this report in any way you want. Creating another creates a single, large notebook with multiple sections, or you can follow the nested notebook with folders structure I provided during the last Assigment. There will be marks given for the structure, coherence, consistency, and clarity of your report \n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Descriptions and Coding Comments**: Each code cell should have comments that describe what the code is doing, any issues or barriers, citations, and other relevant information. Use markdown cells where you explain the problem you are addressing and how you did it (here, you can add *screenshots* from the final outcomes). Some challenges only require you to answer questions and provide insights. This will help the marker evaluate your understanding of the code, the outcomes, and the  problem you have solved.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Data**: As you already know, the challenges usually come with data. Once again, ensure you add a clear restructure and description on how to get large data or any data you can't push into the repo. For larger datasets, you can state that the data will be available in a public folder such as *Google Drive* or *One Drive*. Then, provide instructions on where to add or locate the data to replicate the results properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "   >It is your responsibility to ensure the reproducibility of the repo and notebook. Make sure everything is clearly described and available. This is a typical workflow for most spatial data science projects, particularly in urban analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The length of the report is not restricted, as you may need screenshots, descriptions, and code.\n",
    "   \n",

    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you will replicate the process of creating a geodemographic classification using the k-means clustering algorithm. Please select any city in the UK except London, Liverpool, or Glasgow. The main goal is to generate a meaningful and informative classification that captures the diversity of areas in your dataset using the census data ( For England, you can try to use the 2021 or 2011 census, and for Scotland, you need to use the 2011 census data) \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the main goal for the geodemographic classification (marketing, retail and service planning). \n",
    "2. Look for census data from the selected city for which you would like to generate the geodemographic classification.\n",
    "3. The census data at the Output Area OA level. Select multiple topics of at least four topics (socio-demographics, economics, health, and so on). Describe your topic selection accordingly based on the goal of your geodemographic classification. For example, if your geodemographics are related to marketing, Economic variables might be the appropriate selection. \n",
    "4. Identify the variables that will be crucial for effectively segmenting neighbourhoods. Evaluate how this choice may impact the classification results, including a DEA analysis.\n",
    "5. Prepare, adjust or clean the dataset addressing any missing values or outliers that could distort the clustering results.\n",
    "6. Include standardisation between areas and variables. Make an appropriate analysis and adjust the variable selection accordingly for any multicollinearity.\n",
    "7. Utilize the k-means clustering algorithm to create a classification based on the selected variables.\n",
    "8. Define the optimum number of clusters (i.e., using the Elblow method). Experiment with different values of k.\n",
    "9. Evaluate your cluster groups (e.g., using PCA) and interpret your cluster centres. Describe your results and repeat the process to adjust the variable selection and cluster groups to provide more meaningful results for your geodemographic goal. Interpret the characteristics of each cluster. What demographic patterns or similarities are prevalent within each group?\n",
    "10. Map the final cluster groups\n",
    "11. Finish the analysis by naming the final clusters and plotting a final map that includes the census values and the provided names.\n",
    "12. Finally, acknowledge the subjective nature of classification and make analytical decisions to produce an optimum classification for your specific purpose. Reflect on the challenges and insights gained during the classification process. Ensure you document your analytical decisions and the rationale behind any important decision. Once your geodemographics are constructed, describe the potential use cases for the geodemographic classification you have built based on your initial goal"

However, of course, some researchers might argue that it is reasonable to retain correlated variables so long as each has unique value and meaning.

    "To start with the challenges, defining the characteristics of a cluster was difficult to assess. The word choice and the most important factors to identity cluster by seemed to be reductive in light of all the data analysed. Moreover, by creating these categories, I felt that residents who were in the minority within these OAs were not accounted for. \n",
    "Applying the categories to a more limited subset of the census data (ie a certain age range, etc.) made it difficult to determine which of the population subgroup defnitions were appropriate.

    "#### 12.2 Potential Use Cases \n",
    "In choosing the variables to make this classification, I had in mind a younger demographic, particularly for use by an advertising agency. This informed my selection of the age demographic and the availability of transportation. For example, any advertisements for a cologne or perfume brand would likely want to know the education level and employment type of the people in certain neighborhoods; this would inform the word choice used in advertising. Additionally, knowing whether people are commuters or not will inform the placement of advertisements. To advertise a cologne/perfume to the Suburban Achievers cluster, agencies might decide to invest more in large billboards by roadways. On the other hand, if the target audience are students, understanding their employment type and their spatial distrubution would make for more effective ads and inform their pricing calculations. This can aid the company or brand by providing an understanding of who their consumers are and what values they might share. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential use case for this is for public health interventions. For example, if there is a public health intervention on sexual health and STI testing, understanding the employment type, language preference/understanding, and income would be very relevant factors for targeting certain interventions and for defining the promotional material used. Interventions on public health issues would also be different for families versus single persons, and might need to reflect employment type and whether the population is a student or not. "
